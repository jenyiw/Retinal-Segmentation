# Retinal-Segmentation

Code for doing automatic geometric segmentation of retinal fundus images using Hessian and Laplacian operators. 

# Retinal segmentation using geometric methods with machine learning

This code segments the blood vessels in retinal fundus images using machine learning methods coupled with feature identification using the Hessian and Laplacian operators. It is meant as a test against more advanced deep learning U-Net methods and was inspired by other methods such as the one found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4956315/.
